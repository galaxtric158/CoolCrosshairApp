> [!IMPORTANT]
> there are 2 options if u want to download this.
> </br> - download the app (.exe file)
> </br> - or just download the .py file and run it in your code editor/terminal. (recommended)
> </br> download the .py file [here](https://github.com/galaxtric158/CoolCrosshairApp/tree/main/source/coolcrosshairapp.py)

> [!TIP]
> some of my favorite presets are in the "[source](https://github.com/galaxtric158/CoolCrosshairApp/tree/main/source)" file, and go to the subfolder. (which is "[presets](https://github.com/galaxtric158/CoolCrosshairApp/tree/main/source/presets)") 
> </br> ~if you're lazy to go there manually click on the blue text~

> [!WARNING]
> If you are using the .exe file, make sure to hide your crosshair before closing the GUI, otherwise the crosshair overlay will stay there.
> </br> i'll fix ts in a future update bro today my head hurts
